And what a good job you do at beach. She thinks I'm a fascist? I don't control the railways or the flow of commerce! I don't have anything big planned. Just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies. We fixed everything in the real world so all women are happy and powerful. I'm not Adventure Barbie, I'm Stereotypical Barbie! The real world is forever and irrevocably messed up. I want to be a part of the people that make meaning, not the thing that is made.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VWftr1TwbQ" target="_blank">This is a link.</a> I'm trained to stand confidently here. Shredding waves is much more dangerous than people realize. Horses are just men extenders. I have all the genitals. I am Kenough. What if there's beach? You'll need someone professional in that. Why didn't Barbie tell me about patriarchy? I'm a liberated man. I know crying's not weak. To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest anyways. Sublime! I will beach you both off. Here I'm just a dude and that's enough. You guys are not doing patriarchy very well.</p>

Allans have been in the real word before, no one's noticed! NSYNC? They're all Allans! Yes, even him. He’s Ken’s buddy. All his clothes fit me! Turn this song off for christ’s sake! Don’t tell the Kens, I’m trying to escape. I cannot sit on one more leather couch, it’s going to break my spirit. As soon as they figure out how to build that wall sideways and not just up, no one is going to be able to get in or out.</p>
